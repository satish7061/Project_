    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p> <br> <p> The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your <br>
        choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is <br>
        repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if <br> 
        you didn't, it isn't. <br> <br>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that <br>
        the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its<br>
         children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.<br> <br>
          Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, <br>
             and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, 
        and try <br> another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
        <p>This needs an example</p>
        <img src="Image_root.png" alt="root image">
        <ol>
            <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
            <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
            <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
            <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
            <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
            <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
            <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
        </ol>
        <b>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could <br>
             make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we <br>
             have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</b>
             <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
            <pre>boolean solve(Node n) { <br>if n is a leaf node {
                <br> if the leaf is a goal node, return true <br>else return false <br>} else { <br>for each child c of n<br> {<br> if solve(c) succeeds, return true <br>} <br>return false<br> } <br>}
            </pre>
            <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If<br>
                 solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to<br>
                 some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
                 <h3>How does this work?</h3>
                 <ul>
                    <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
                    <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <br> 
                 <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any<br>
                     child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
             <pre>for each child c of n {<br> if solve(c) succeeds, return true<br> }<br>return false</pre>
             <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal <br>
                node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
         <pre>if n is a leaf node { <br>if the leaf is a goal node, return true<br> else return false<br> }</pre> 
         <br>
         <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><h3>To search a tree:</h3></li>
         </ul> 
         <ol>
            <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have <br>
                searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
         </ol> 
         <h2>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2> 
         <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact,<br>
             that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>
        <pre>boolean solve(Node n) { 
            <br>put node n on the stack; 
            <br>while the stack is not empty { 
                <br>if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
                    <br> if it is a goal node, return true 
                    <br>else pop it off the stack 
                    <br>} 
                    <br>else { 
                        <br>if the node at the top of the stack has untried children 
                        <br>push the next untried child onto the stack
                        <br> else pop the node off the stack 
                        <br>} 
                        <br>return false
                        <br> }
        </pre> 
        <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the<br>
             stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the<br>
             tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,<br>
              if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the<br> problem.</p><br> 
              <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal<br> node.</p><br>
               <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of<br>
                recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node<br>
                 at the current level, or storing it in an array.</p><br>
             <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p>
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n) {
              if n is a leaf node {
               if the leaf is a goal node {
                print n
                 return true
                }
                 else return false
               } else {
                for each child c of n {
                 if solve(c) succeeds {
                  print n
                  return true
                 }
                }
                 return false
                } 
               }
        </pre>         
        <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
        <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty<br>
           simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:</p><br>
        <p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate<br>
           solutions</p><br>
        <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test<br>
           whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b>isLeaf).</b> This method would encapsulate all the<br>
           ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.<br> 
        <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have<br> 
           been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying for each child<br>
           <b>c of n.</b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through<br> 
           them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can<br> 
           represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track<br> 
           of which ones you've already examined?</p><br> 
        <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the<br> 
           node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When<br> 
           the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require<br> 
           quite a lot of additional work.</p> 
        <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an<br> 
           ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.</p> 
        <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried<br> 
           <b>child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children k+1 through n. Or, if you<br> 
           are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow fails,<br> 
           you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <b>(or perhaps<br> 
           north, east, south, west).</b></p> 
        <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <b>In the chess game example,</b> you might number your<br> 
           pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several<br> 
           moves, and these must also be ordered.</p> 
        <h2>Example: Tree Search</h2>
        <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the<br> 
            simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.</p> 
        <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point<br> 
           to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child.<br> 
           All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not<br> 
           part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The<br> 
           first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p> 
        <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
    <pre>
        public class BinaryTree {
             BinaryTree leftChild = null;
              BinaryTree rightChild = null;
               boolean isGoalNode = false;
                String name;
                 BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                     this.name = name;
                      leftChild = left;
                       rightChild = right;
                        this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
                     } 
                    }
    </pre>
    <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.</p>
    <pre>static BinaryTree makeTree() {
         BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
          c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
           d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
            e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
             f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
              a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
               b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
                root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
                 return root;
                 }
    </pre>
    <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
    <pre>
        public static void main(String args[]) {
             BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
              System.out.println(solvable(tree));
             }
    </pre>
    <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
    <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
             /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false;
              /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true; 
              /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true; 
              /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; 
              /* 5 */ return false;
             }
    </pre>
    <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without<br> 
            first checking whether those children actually exist.</li><br>
        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li><br>  
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null<br> 
            and is not a goal node, says to</li><br>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li><br>
        <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>       
    </ol>
    <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
    <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An <br>
       alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>
    <pre>static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
         if (node.isGoalNode) return true; 
         if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true; 
         if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; 
         return false;
        }
    </pre>  
    <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
    <h2>What are the children?</h2>
    <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous <br>
       choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the<br> 
       right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without<br> 
       recursion.</p> 
    <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter<br> 
       how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the<br> 
       same color.</p> 
    <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are<br> 
       colored.</p> 
    <p>There are two ways to do this:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li><br>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of<br> 
            countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a<br> 
        checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
    <p><b>boolean mapIsOK()</b><br> 
        Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p><br> 
    <p><b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b><br> 
        Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p><br> 
    <p><b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</b> <br>
        Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).</p>
    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <pre>boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {
         if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOK(); 
         map[row][column] = color; for (int nextColor = RED; 
         nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
             int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
              if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
             } 
             return false;
            }
    </pre>
    <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
    <pre>
        boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) { 
            if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return true;
             if (okToColor(row, column, color)) { map[row][column] = color; 
                for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE;
                 nextColor++) { int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column); 
                    if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
                 } 
                } 
                return false; 
            }
    </pre>
    <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p>
        <table border="1">
        <tr align="center">
            <td></td>
            <td bgcolor="grey">2 by 3 map</td>
            <td bgcolor="grey">3 by 3 map</td>
            <td bgcolor="grey">3 by 4 map</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td bgcolor="grey">Method1:</td>
            <td>60ms.</td>
            <td>940ms.</td>
            <td>60530ms. (1minute)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td bgcolor="grey">Method2:</td>
            <td>0ms.</td>
            <td>0ms.</td>
            <td>0ms.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of<br> 
       these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will<br> 
       often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically<br> 
       guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>
    <h2>Debugging techniques</h2>
    <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall<br> 
        back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be<br> 
        applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</p>
    <p><b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b><br><br>
         Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably<br> 
         want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long<br> 
         list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p>
    <p><b>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</b><br><br> 
        Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself<br> 
        contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.</p>
    <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs<br> 
        the proportions will be better.</p>
    <pre>static String indent = ""; 
        static String name(BinaryTree node) {
             if (node == null) return null; 
             else return node.name;
             } 
             static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
                 System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); 
                 indent = indent + "| ";
                 } 
                 static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
                     indent = indent.substring(3);
                      System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); 
                      return true; 
                    } 
                    static boolean no(BinaryTree node) { 
                        indent = indent.substring(3); 
                        System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false"); 
                        return false;
                    }
    </pre>
    <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
    <pre>static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { 
        enter(node); 
        if (node == null) return no(node); 
        if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node); 
        if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node); 
        if (solvable(node.rightChild)) 
        return yes(node); 
        return no(node); 
    }

    </pre>
    <p>And we get these results:</p>
    <pre>Entering solvable(Root) 
        | Entering solvable(A) 
        | | Entering solvable(C) 
        | | | Entering solvable(null) 
        | | | solvable(null) returns false 
        | | | Entering solvable(null) 
        | | | solvable(null) returns false 
        | | solvable(C) returns false 
        | | Entering solvable(D) 
        | | | Entering solvable(null) 
        | | | solvable(null) returns false 
        | | | Entering solvable(null) 
        | | | solvable(null) returns false 
        | | solvable(D) returns false 
        | solvable(A) returns false 
        | Entering solvable(B) 
        | | Entering solvable(E) 
        | | solvable(E) returns true 
        | solvable(B) returns true 
        solvable(Root) returns true 
        true
    </pre>
    <p><b>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</b></p>
    <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug<br> 
       the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?</p> 
    <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to<br> 
       your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example,<br> 
       you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these<br> 
       changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.</p> 
    <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>
    <pre>static final boolean debugging = false; 
        static void enter(BinaryTree node) { 
            if (debugging) { 
                System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); 
                indent = indent + "| "; 
            } 
        } 
        static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) { 
            if (debugging) { 
                indent = indent.substring(3); 
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); 
            } 
            return true; 
        } 
        static boolean no(BinaryTree node) { 
            if (debugging) { 
                indent = indent.substring(3); 
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false"); 
            } 
            return false; 
        }
    </pre>
    <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about<br> 
       making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the <br>
       controlled code will be discarded.</p>
    <p><b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b></p>
    <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message<br> 
       printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.<br> 
       However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following<br> 
       code
    </p>
    <pre>new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre>
    <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a<br> 
       print statement.
    </p>
    <pre>java.lang.Exception: Checkpoint Charlie 
        at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:53) 
        at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:57) 
        at TreeSearch.main(TreeSearch.java:72)

    <h2>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h2>
    <p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number<br> 
       of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with<br> 
       the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.
    </p>

            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
            <td><img src="white-ball.png" alt=""></td>
            <td><img src="white-ball.png" alt=""></td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The goal is to reverse the positions of the marbles:</p>
    <table border="1" bgcolor="#d8d8d8" cellpadding="6">

            <td><img src="black-ball.png" alt=""></td>
            <td><img src="black-ball.png" alt=""></td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><b>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a<br> 
        marble can either:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
            <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.</li>

   <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,<br> 
        which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p> 
    <p>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the<br> 
        puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to<br> 
        print out the bad news.</p> 
    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,<br> 
        which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p> 
    <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board<br> 
        position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node.<br> 
        Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.</p> 
    <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of<br> 
        approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find<br> 
        a different but equally valid approach.</p> 
    <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump.<br> 
        If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and<br> 
        check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require<br> 
        having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the<br> 
        board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.</p> 
    <p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a<br> 
        particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that<br> 
        must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight<br> 
        complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p>
    <b>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each<br> 
        space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int<br> 
        position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from<br> 
        that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board,<br> 
        rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative"<br> 
        rather than "mutative."</p> 
    <p> Along with <b>canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods <b>puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that<br>
         should be obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be written as follows:</p>
    <pre>boolean solvable(int[] board) { 
        if (puzzleSolved(board)) { 
            return true;
         } 
         for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) { 
            if (canMove(board, position)) { 
                int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); 
                if (solvable(newBoard)) { printBoard(newBoard); 
                    return true; 
                } 
            } 
        } 
        return false; 
    }
    </pre>
    <p>Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.<br> 
       <br> Here is some output from the program:</p>
    
       <ol type="16" reversed> 
        <table>
          <tr><li><b>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</b></tr></li>
          <li><b>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK</b></li>
          <li><b>WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
          <li><b>WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
          <li><b>WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
          <li><b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ BLACK</b></li>
          <li><b>WHITR BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____</b></li>
          <li><b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE</b></li>
          <li><strong>WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</strong></li>
          <li><strong>_____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</strong></li>

          <li><strong>BLACK BLACK BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE</strong></li>
        </table>
      </ol>
      <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: <big>BLACK</big> starts out on the left and <big>WHITE</big> on the right, as in the last<br> 
        line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always 
        produces its<br> 
        results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get<br> 
        them in correct order.</p>
